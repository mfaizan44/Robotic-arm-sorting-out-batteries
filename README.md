# Robotic arm sorting out batteries


This project implements an automated sorting line with an industrial robot for batteries based on visual and depth sensors. The system utilizes few-shot learning methods for visual detection, allowing it to not rely on large datasets.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a robotic system capable of accurately sorting different types of batteries, including AA, D, and 9V batteries, in an industrial setting. The system uses an Epson VT6 robot equipped with an electromagnetic gripper, along with visual and depth sensors, to detect and classify batteries based on their size and shape.

## Features

- Automated sorting of AA, D, and 9V batteries.
- Utilizes visual and depth sensors for object detection.
- Few-shot learning methods for visual detection.
- Real-time sorting and classification of batteries.
- Improved efficiency and accuracy compared to manual sorting methods.

## Code

The code for this project is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mfaizan44/Robotic-arm-sorting-out-batteries). The repository contains detailed instructions on how to set up the system and run the code.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the system is available at [Train Data & Test Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BnLuf_FTUME0__BmJJTMBvCkZ9AJFn8p?usp=sharing). The dataset includes images of AA, D, and 9V batteries in various orientations and lighting conditions.

## Requirements

- Epson VT6 robot with electromagnetic gripper.
- Visual and depth sensors.
- YOLOv8 object detection model.
- Python programming language.

## Usage

To use the system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies as specified in the repository.
4. Run the main script to start the automated sorting process.

## Demo Video

A demo video showcasing the project in action will be shared separately.
